# Item (Classical Book) Catalog

## About

This is a **RESTful** web application, using the Python framework **Flask,** that provides a list of items (books) within a variety of _categories_ (genres) as well as provide a user registration and authentication system. Registered users will have the ability to **post,** **edit** and **delete** their own items. Modern web applications perform a variety of functions and provide amazing features and utilities to their users; but deep down, itâ€™s really all just creating, reading, updating and deleting data.

### What is needed:
You'll run these program using a Unix-style terminal on your computer; the point of it is to be able to offer the same software (Linux) regardless of what kind of computer you're running on. If you are using a Mac or Linux system, your regular terminal program will do just fine. On Windows, we recommend using the Git Bash terminal that comes with the Git software.

In order to make use of third party authentication and authorization (google OAuth) feature, one will require a google account.

### Geting Started
##### Virtual machine
- Download and install [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Download_Old_Builds_5_1). Install the platform package for your operating system. You do not need the extension pack or the SDK. You do not need to launch VirtualBox after installing it; Vagrant will do that. **Ubuntu users:** If you are running Ubuntu 14.04, install VirtualBox using the Ubuntu Software Center instead. Due to a reported bug, installing VirtualBox from the site may uninstall other software you need.
- Download and Install [vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html). You can check if vagrant is installed by running `vagrant --version`
- Download the [VM configuration](https://s3.amazonaws.com/video.udacity-data.com/topher/2018/April/5acfbfa3_fsnd-virtual-machine/fsnd-virtual-machine.zip). Unzip the file. Using the terminal, navigate into the vagrant subdirectory.
- Clone the **_catalog-project_** and move it into the _/FSND-Virtual-Machine/vagrant/_ subdirectory. This particular step can actually be done at any point in time, but to avoid any confusion, do this.
- From your terminal, inside the vagrant subdirectory, run the command `vagrant up`. This will cause Vagrant to download the Linux operating system and install it. This may take quite a while (many minutes) depending on how fast your Internet connection is. When vagrant up is finished running, you will get your shell prompt back. At this point, you can run `vagrant ssh` to log in to your newly installed Linux VM! Inside the VM, change directory to **_/vagrant_** and look around with `ls`.

The files you see here are the same as the ones in the _/FSND-Virtual-Machine/vagrant/_ subdirectory on your computer (where you started Vagrant from). Any file you create in one will be automatically shared to the other. This means that you can edit code in your favorite text editor, and run it inside the VM.

##### OAuth
- Go to [console.developers.google](https://console.developers.google.com/apis)
- Create a new project and name it _Book-ish_, just for the sake of consistency, but you can name it whatever you like
- Go to the _Credentials_ section. Go to the _OAuth consent screen tab_ first of all. You only have to enter the _application name_. Then back to the _credentials_ tab, create a new _OAuth client ID_. Make sure you select **_Web Application_**. The name can be whatever. _Authorized JavaScript origin:_ should be: _http://localhost:8000_. _Authorized redirect URIs:_ _http://localhost:8000/login_ and _http://localhost:8000/gconnect_. Save and create. You'll be presented with a _client ID_ and _client secrets_.
- Now, download the _JSON_ attached to the _OAuth client ID_ you just created. **Make sure you do this after the above steps have been completed. If you do it before, the origins and authorized uris may not appear in the JSON file.**
- Rename the JSON file as **_client_secrets.json_**. You can delete the dummy _public_client_secrets.json_ file that comes with the _catalog-project._ And you're good to go for the authentication and authorization.

Files in the VM's _/vagrant_ directory are shared with the vagrant folder on your computer. But other data inside the VM is not. For instance the project dependencies **are not**. You can `cd` into the _/catalog-project_ directory (or whatever you named it when cloning).

### How to run app
And for the moment you've been waiting for, while in the the _project_ directory, via your terminal:

- First, enter the command `python3 database_setup.py`
- Second, enter `python3 install_categories.py`
- Third, enter `python3 application.py`
